        <h1>Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK)</h1>




        <p>
            Minimum shift keying (MSK) is a special case of binary CPFSK with modulation index h = 0.5. It has features
            such as constant envelope, compact spectrum and good error rate performance. The fundamental problem with
            MSK is that the spectrum is not compact enough to satisfy the stringent requirements with respect to out-of
            band radiation for technologies like GSM and DECT standard. These technologies have very high data rates
            approaching the RF channel bandwidth. A plot of MSK spectrum will reveal that the sidelobes with significant
            energy, extend well beyond the transmission data rate. This is problematic, since it causes severe
            out-of-band interference in systems with closely spaced adjacent channels. To satisfy such requirements, the
            MSK spectrum can be easily manipulated by using a pre-modulation low pass filter (LPF). The pre-modulation
            LPF should have the following properties and it is found that a Gaussian LPF will satisfy all of them <br>
            • Sharp cut-off and narrow bandwidth - needed to suppress high frequency components. <br>
            • Lower overshoot in the impulse response - providing protection against excessive instantaneous frequency
            deviations. <br>
            • Preservation of filter output pulse area - thereby coherent detection can be applicable.

        <p>Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) is a modified MSK modulation technique, where the spectrum of MSK is
            manipulated by passing the rectangular shaped information pulses through a Gaussian LPF prior to the
            frequency modulation of the carrier. A typical Gaussian LPF, used in GMSK modulation standards, is defined
            by the zero-mean Gaussian (bell-shaped) impulse response.

        <p>The parameter B is the 3-dB bandwidth of the LPF, which is determined from a parameter called BTb</p>

        <p>The equation for h(t) defines the impulse response of the LPF, whereas the equation for g(t), also called as
            frequency pulse shaping function, defines the LPF’s output when the filter gets excited with a rectangular
            pulse.</p>

            <h3>GMSK demodulator</h3>
        </div>
        <p>There exists numerous methods to demodulate a GMSK signal. We used cross-coupled IQ coherent demodulator.The
            received signal, r(t), is first converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) using a band pass filter.

            With the help of a recovered carrier, the IF signal is translated to baseband using the IQ implementation.
            The LPF filters in the inphase and quadrature arms, are simply used to remove the 2 fi f frequency
            components that result from the down conversion multipliers. The baseband signals I(t) and Q(t) can be used
            by the decision algorithm (MLSE, parallel/serial type MSK detection etc..,) for data detection. From the
            modulator structure shown in Figure 2.32, it can be readily seen that the baseband inphase and quadrature
            components are correlated as:-

        <!-- img9  -->
        <div class="pic">
            <img src="/9.png" alt="">
        </div>




        <p>At this stage, it is tempting to deduce the phase information φ(t) directly from the baseband quadrature
            components as</p>

        </div>
        <p>Though, the above equation is mathematically correct, applying this direct approach for the detection at the
            receiver, is not a good solution, especially when the received signal is mixed with noise. Due to the
            addition of noise, any slight deviation in the detected instantaneous phase, leads to error propagation.
            Since the GMSK is a continuous phase modulation scheme, the correct method is to find the phase difference
            over a single bit interval and then build a decision logic using that phase difference. The phase difference
            over one bit interval (Tb) is given as

        <p>The data bits are decided by applying hard decision on the sign of the above cross-coupled term (now you can
            relate how the demodulator in Figure 2.35 got the cross-coupled structure).</p>
